      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-heading mb-6">Terms and Conditions</h1>

      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        These Terms and Conditions govern your request, purchase, or receipt of data recovery services from
        DataRecoveryServices (referred to as "we", "us", or "our"). By submitting a case, you agree to these terms.
        We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Evaluation Process</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        The evaluation helps assess the chances of recovery and required resources. Evaluation fees must be paid in advance.
        If you do not ship your device, the evaluation fee is refundable within 3 working days upon request. Once a device
        is delivered or a shipping label is used, the fee becomes non-refundable.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Service Quote and Authorization</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Upon accepting the quote, you must electronically approve the service and provide payment authorization. Timelines
        are estimates and may vary due to technical issues. Return storage devices are not included in the quoted cost.
      </p>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Customers are responsible for submitting the correct device. If an incorrect device is sent and recovery is
        completed, you will still be charged. Terms are finalized in the signed quote agreement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Completed Recovery Service</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        We make every effort to recover data. Once complete, we will contact you to verify recovered files. Terms of the
        completed service are outlined in your signed agreement.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Data Delivery Options</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Recovered data will only be released after full payment. We offer delivery via encrypted external drive or secure
        cloud. Return drive costs are additional. Shipping encryption is applied by default.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Unsuccessful Recovery</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        If recovery is not possible, you will not be charged for service unless a non-refundable fee was agreed upon.
        Return shipping is the customer's responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Return of Original Media</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Devices may be returned upon request. You are responsible for shipping fees. Accessories like cables and enclosures
        are discarded during evaluation and are not returned.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Abandoned Media</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Devices left unclaimed for 30+ days may be recycled or destroyed. Certificates of destruction are available upon request.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Service Limitations</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Data recovery cannot be guaranteed. Devices may become further damaged during recovery. We are not liable for unrecoverable
        data or device failure unless damage was intentional.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Payment Terms</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        No upfront payment is required unless agreed. We accept multiple payment methods and offer plans. Full payment must be made
        prior to data release.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Refund Policy</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Evaluation fees are refundable only if the device is not shipped. Upfront service fees are non-refundable. Once results
        are verified remotely, no refund is possible.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Personal Data</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Confidentiality</h2>

        We treat all recovered data as confidential and do not access or share it unless required by law.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Disclaimer</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">

        by the customer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Our liability is limited to the amount paid for services. We are not responsible for lost profits, indirect damages,

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-heading mt-8 mb-3">Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <p className="text-base text-body mb-4">
        Disputes will first be resolved through executive negotiation (within 30 days), then mediation (within 45 days), and if
        unresolved, through binding arbitration in New York City under applicable rules. Each party pays their share of mediation.
        Arbitration is final and replaces any court process.
